//! Retransmission is covered in section 6.3 of RFC 4960.
//!
//! 1. Perform round-trip time (RTT) measurements from the time a TSN is sent until it is
//!    acknowledged.
//!    a) A measurement must be made once per round-trip, but no more.  I interpret this to mean
//!       that only one measurement may be in progress at a time.
//!    b) Measurements must not be made on retransmissions.  If the TSN being measured is
//!       retransmitted, the measurement must be aborted.
//! 2. Adjust the retransmission timeout (RTO) after every measurement is concluded.
//!    a) Use the specified smoothing algorithm to calculate a new RTO.
//!    b) Clamp the new RTO to RTO.Min .. Option<RTO.Max>
//!    c) If RTTVAR is zero, increase it to the clock granularity.
//! 3. Manage the retransmission timer ("T3-rtx").
//!    R1) On any DATA send, if the timer is not running, start the timer with RTO.
//!    R2) If all outstanding data has been acknowledged, then cancel the timer.
//!    R3) If the earliest outstanding TSN is acknowledged, then restart the timer.
//! // TODO:
//!    R4) When a TSN previously acknowledged in a gap ack block is no longer acknowledged (e.g. it
//!        was dropped by the peer), then start the timer.
//! 4. Handle timer expiration.
//!    // TODO:
//!    E1) Update congestion control as needed.
//!       - adjust ssthresh according to Section 7.2.3
//!       - set cwnd to the MTU
//!    E2) Double RTO up to RTO.Max to provide back-off.
//!    E3) Retransmit as many of the earliest DATA chunks as will fit into a single packet based on
//!        the MTU.
//!        - Any remaining DATA chunks should be "marked for retransmission" and sent as soon as
//!          cwnd allows.
//!    E4) Restart the timer according to (R1) above.
